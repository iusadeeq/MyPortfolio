  <h1>My SIWES Learning Notes</h1>

  <div class="note-section">
    <h2>1. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</h2>
    <p>HTML is the foundation of all web pages. It structures content into elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and images. I learned to create forms, tables, and semantic layouts using tags like &lt;section&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, &lt;header&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt;.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="note-section">
    <h2>2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</h2>
    <p>CSS is used for styling HTML elements. I practiced how to add colors, layouts (flexbox, grid), spacing, and animations. I also learned how to use internal, inline, and external stylesheets effectively to build responsive and professional designs.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="note-section">
    <h2>3. JavaScript</h2>
    <p>JavaScript adds interactivity to websites. I worked on basic DOM manipulation, events (like clicks), and simple logic building. As projects, I built a Digital Clock and a Quiz App using JavaScript only.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="note-section">
    <h2>4. Visual Studio Code</h2>
    <p>VS Code is a powerful code editor. I learned to use extensions, themes, live server for previews, and the terminal for Git commands. It made web development easier and more organized.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="note-section">
    <h2>5. Git and GitHub</h2>
    <p>I learned how to initialize a Git repository, track changes, commit, and push my code to GitHub. I also hosted my portfolio website using GitHub Pages, which is a valuable skill for any developer.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="note-section">
    <h2>6. Portfolio Website</h2>
    <p>To showcase my skills and projects, I built a portfolio website. It includes my bio, skills, project links, and learning resources. This portfolio helps me present what I’ve learned during my SIWES.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="note-section">
    <h2>7. Challenges Faced</h2>
    <p>Although my SIWES center (UDUTH) didn’t provide direct training in software development, I independently pursued knowledge using online tutorials and practice projects. This taught me self-learning, persistence, and practical skills.</p>
